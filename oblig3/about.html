                    <p>
                        I have choose the Target group #3, because I don't really know how to make a good design for
                        children that is Entertaining and informative at the same time, while also endulging the UN
                        Target.

                    <p>
                        I also had some problems choosing the Texts for this reference group, but this was more an Issue
                        of myself, because i wanted to include as much information about this topic as possible.

                        I had some good insperation from the awwwards site and youtube videos. A webiste I really liked
                        was for example <a href="https://www.theclimatepledge.com/"
                            target="_blank">https://www.theclimatepledge.com/</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried to create an Universal design that most people can understand and follow. Especially my
                        target group. Since my target group are people between 16 and 18, I tried to do an minimalistic
                        but still colorfull design, that would trigger more engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Idea for the Color gradient in the Heading of the index page wa from a YouTube video.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main page should be as inviting as possible and easy navigatable. So I created a good
                        looking first page. I made my design so only "one aspect" or element is the main object if you
                        scroll down (at least on the desktop). I've did this, so users could focus on one thing at the
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also created some easy navigation controls, like in the top where you could always jump to
                        another site or, the horizontal scroll bar which enables the users to get a brief overview of
                        the headlines and contents to jump to. In the end I also added a back to the top link where
                        users would get back to the top if clicked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The colum design of the headline page uses grid instead of flex, because I would have to use two
                        flex to create this layout I wanted. I used flex most of the time later on.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Images
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I tried to only include .svg images since they are relatively small while staying in good
                        quality, no matter the screensize and therefor the filesize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have tried to get the images first before designing the page more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was looking for stylized images (sort of the google material design images with stylized
                        figureens). I have found some eventally, but as I said before that did not quiet fit in my color
                        schema as before.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Colors
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to get the images first, because I could create an colorplate out of them.
                        Unfortunatly, my first image I choose was the "act-now.svg".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other images came after that and might not fit that good to the other images that are all in
                        the same color schema. But afterall it does look decent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using green as the background image links to topic to climate and nature. And using yellow as
                        the color for the cards/text fields symbolises a danger or a warning that this is a urgent
                        topic. Choosing yellow instead of something more red, also symbolises that it's still not to
                        late to act.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Fonts
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I choose the fonts as the last step because it did not matter to me in the first place. I did
                        choose two fonts I like from one of the websites that suggest Font combos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The suggested fonts were Okay, but I didn't liked the headings font, so I have choosen another
                        one that I liked more. I have choosen the archivo font because it is more "spectacular" than the
                        other ones.

                    <p>
                        I used a small animation to guide to user to scroll down to see the other contents of the
                        page(s).

                    <p>
                        I had some trubbles getting the Info texts together, while mainting a good partion of
                        information and at the same time not overloading the main page with text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I eventually figured it out and copied most of the texts from the UN website. I used a
                        blockquote back then to reference to the website where I copied the texts. But Carlos suggested
                        that I should use ChatGPT to rewrite the texts a little bit so that I don't have to use the
                        blockquotes.

                    <p>
                        I have taken a lot of messures to make the files as small as possible to reduce the carbon
                        footprint. If you load the main page, only around 631 KB will be transmitted from the server.

                        I have subsetted the fonts with fontsquerriel, which reduced the (overall) font size from 818 KB
                        to 48 KB (if your Browser supports .woff2)

                        As mentioned before, I used most of the time .svg from the start. Only the images in the about
                        site were .png files, which I reduced from 104 KB to 27.2 KB while converting them to .webp.

                    <p>
                        I have used multiple validotors to ensure no errors in the HTML or CSS code, or that my website

                        contrast issues, which I fixed right away.

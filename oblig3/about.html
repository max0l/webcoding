                        Targeted Reference Group
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I have chosen the Target group #3 because I don't really know how to make a good design for
                        children that is entertaining and informative at the same time, while also indulging the UN
                        Target.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also had some problems selecting the Texts for this reference group, but this was more an
                        Issue
                        of myself because i wanted to include as much information about this topic as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have made a sketch first of what I imagined the site to look like later.

                    <p>
                        I had some inspiration from the awwwards site and youtube videos as well. A website I really
                        liked
                        was for example <a href="https://www.theclimatepledge.com/"
                            target="_blank">www.theclimatepledge.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried to create an Universal design that most people can understand and follow. Especially my
                        target group. Since my target group are people between 16 and 18, I tried to do an minimalistic
                        but still colorful design, that would trigger more engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main page should be as inviting as possible and easy navigable. So I created a good
                        looking first page. I made my design so only "one aspect" or element is the main object if you
                        scroll down (at least on the desktop). I've done this, so users could focus on one thing at the
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also created some easy navigation controls, like in the top where you could always jump to
                        another site or, the horizontal scroll bar which enables the users to get a brief overview of
                        the headlines and contents to jump to. In the end, I also added a back to the top link where
                        users would get back to the top if clicked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The colum design of the headline page uses grid instead of flex, because I would have to use two
                        flex to create this layout I wanted. I used flex most of the time later on.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Images
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I tried to include only .svg images since they are relatively small while staying in good
                        quality, no matter the screen size and therefor the file size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was looking for stylized images (sort of the google material design images with stylized
                        figureens). Unfortunately, the last imags did not fit so well in the colorschema from to first
                        one ("act-now.svg"), but it still looked good.
                    </p>
                    <h3>

                    <p>
                        The first picture I chose was the insperation for my colorplate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using green as the background color because it links to the topic of climate and nature. And
                        using yellow as
                        the color for the cards/text fields symbolizes a danger or a warning that this is a urgent
                        topic. Choosing yellow instead of something more red, also symbolizes that it's still not too
                        late to act.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Fonts
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose the fonts as the last step because it did not matter to me in the first place. I did
                        chose two fonts I like from one of the websites that suggest Font combos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The suggested fonts were Okay, but I didn't liked the font for the headings, so I have picked
                        another
                        one that I liked more. I have chosen the archivo font because it is more "spectacular" than the
                        other ones.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I used a small animation to guide to user to scroll down to see the other contents of the
                        page(s).

                    <p>
                        I had some troubles getting the Info texts together, while mainting a good partion of
                        information and at the same time not overloading the main page with text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I eventually figured it out and copied most of the texts from the UN website. I used a
                        blockquote back then to reference to the website where I copied the texts. But Carlos suggested
                        that I should use ChatGPT to rewrite the texts a little bit so that I don't have to use the
                        blockquotes.

                    <p>
                        I have taken a lot of measures to make the files as small as possible to reduce the carbon
                        footprint. If you load the main page, only around 631 KB will be transmitted from the server.

                    <p>
                        I have subsetted the fonts with fontsquerriel, which reduced the (overall) font size from 818 KB
                        to 48 KB (if your Browser supports .woff2)

                        As mentioned before, I used most of the time .svg from the start. Only the images in the about
                        site were .png files, which I reduced from 104 KB to 27.2 KB while converting them to .webp.

                    <p>
                        I have used multiple validators to ensure no errors in the HTML or CSS code, or that my website
                        has any accessibility issues.

                        For the accessibility validator, I used <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/"

                    <p>
                        Bot said that I just had minor issues, like a too long alt text for the images and some color
                        contrast issues, which I fixed right away.

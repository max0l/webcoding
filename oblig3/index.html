                <p>
                    Climate change is a real threat to everyone on Earth. We are already seeing its effects, and they
                    will become much worse if we don't act now. By educating ourselves, using new innovations, and
                    keeping our climate promises, we can make the changes needed to protect our planet. These actions
                    also offer big opportunities to update our infrastructure, create new jobs, and increase prosperity
                    around the world. This website will educate you about this topic.
                </p>
                <h3>Targets</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone can help to make sure that we meet the Global Goals. Use these five targets to create
                    action to combat climate change.
                <ul>
                    <li>Be Ready for Disasters: Help all countries prepare and adapt to climate disasters and risks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Plan for Climate Change: Add climate change solutions into national plans and policies.</li>
                    <li>Learn & Act: Teach people how to deal with climate change, reduce its effects, and prepare for
                        emergencies.</li>
                    <li>Support Developing Countries: Developed countries should fund $100 billion a year to help
                        developing nations fight climate change and make the Green Climate Fund fully operational.</li>
                    <li>Focus on Local Action: Help less developed countries and small islands improve climate planning,
                        especially for women, youth, and vulnerable communities.</li>

                    What Is Climate Change?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns. While some shifts
                    can happen naturally, such as through volcanic eruptions or changes in the sun’s activity, since the
                    1800s, human activities have been the main cause of climate change. This is largely due to burning
                    fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These activities release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in
                    the atmosphere like a blanket, causing the Earth to warm. Major sources of these gases include cars,
                    coal-powered buildings, deforestation, agriculture, and oil and gas operations. Key sectors driving
                    greenhouse gas emissions are energy, industry, transport, buildings, and land use.

                <h2>
                    What causes climate change?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climate change is largely caused by human activities. Scientists have shown that nearly all global
                    warming in the last 200 years is due to actions like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and
                    industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases that trap heat and warm the planet
                    faster than ever before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the late 1800s, Earth's surface temperature has risen by about 1.2°C, making it warmer now
                    than at any time in the past 100,000 years. The last decade was the hottest on record, with each
                    decade since 1850 getting progressively warmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Climate change isn't just about rising temperatures. Because everything on Earth is connected, these
                    changes trigger other effects, such as extreme weather, melting ice, and rising sea levels,
                    disrupting ecosystems and human lives.

                    Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some
                    of us
                    are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island
                    nations
                    and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have
                    advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts
                    are
                    putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by
                    weather-related events is expected to rise.

                    Solutions to Climate Change
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Climate change is a major challenge, but we already have solutions that can protect the planet,
                    improve our lives, and boost the economy. Global agreements like the Paris Agreement guide us
                    toward progress by focusing on three key actions: cutting emissions, adapting to impacts, and
                    financing necessary changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most effective solutions is switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources
                    like solar and wind. To limit warming to 1.5°C, we must act quickly. About half of the needed
                    emissions cuts must happen by 2030, with fossil fuel production decreasing by 6% each year. By
                    starting now, we can build a sustainable future for everyone.
                </p>

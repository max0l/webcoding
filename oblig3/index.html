                        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts
                        can
                        be natural, due to changes in the sun's activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the
                        1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the
                        burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped
                        around
                        the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and
                        methane.
                        These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for
                        example.
                        Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and
                        gas
                        operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings,
                        agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.

                        Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating
                        over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing
                        greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two
                        thousand years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The average temperature of the Earth's surface is now about 1.2°C warmer than it was in the
                        late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last
                        100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, and each of the last
                        four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is
                        only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is
                        connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others.

                        Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some
                        of us
                        are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island
                        nations
                        and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have
                        advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts
                        are
                        putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by
                        weather-related events is expected to rise.

                        Climate change is a huge challenge, but we already know many solutions. These can
                        deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We
                        also have global agreements to guide progress, such as the UN Framework Convention
                        on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cut
                        emissions, adapt to climate impacts and finance required adjustments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar will reduce
                        the emissions driving climate change. But we have to start right now. While a growing
                        coalition of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, about half of
                        emissions cuts must be in place by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel
                        production must decline by roughly 6 per cent per year between 2020 and 2030.

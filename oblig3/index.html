                        What Is Climate Change?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts
                        can
                        be natural, due to changes in the sun's activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the
                        1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the
                        burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
                    </p>
                    Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around
                    the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures.
                    <p>
                        The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and
                        methane.
                        These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for
                        example.
                        Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and
                        gas
                        operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings,
                        agriculture and land use are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.

                        How does Climate Change effects us?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some
                        of us
                        are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island
                        nations
                        and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have
                        advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts
                        are
                        putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of people displaced by
                        weather-related events is expected to rise.

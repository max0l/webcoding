                        This game is about doing something <strong>NOT</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wait what?

                        Yeah. You read it correclty. This game wants to help you to participate in helping the planet.
                        This is done by asking you to do something <strong>not</strong>. We know, that following those
                        kind of rules are not easy all the time. But we want to reward you for participating if you can
                        and encourage long term participartation.

                        How to play
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Playing is easy: if you do something that's on the list below, you get the corresponding points.
                        The points will be collected in a printed table (table.pdf) and will summed up at the end of the
                        week. The goal is to get every week a better highscore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you have trash in your hands, <strong>don't</strong> throw it in the nature and
                        instead use a bin which will give you 10 Points. Or if you are able to <strong>not</strong> use
                        the car for short routes, that will give you 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best way to play this game is with your friends and family, so you can all engage in saving
                        the planet while competing with the others for the most points. Having this competetion will
                        engage all of you to make the difference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A (printable) template for adding the points per week can be found here: <a
                            href="assets/files/table.pdf" target="_blank">table.pdf</a>. But the best would be if you
                        would write it in a document right away, to keep track with it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        What can you do with the points?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The points are an indicator for how much you think before you might do something bad to the
                        environment. The goal is to get more and more points per week. To keep track, you can download
                        our PDF.

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am the youngest child of my house. Due to my condition, I have learned to use my wit and intellect to overcome
        the prejudice I have to face all the time.</p>
    <p>I have had a very tough life. My father despites me. Many people tried to murder me during my whole life. Among
        them, my sister, after being falsely accused of poisoning my nephew. I was lucky then, and my brother saved me.
        Since then, I have lived in exile and now I serve the enemy of my house.</p>
    <p>You may remember what I said at my trial, when I was falsely accused of killing my nephew, the King:
        <q>I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime: I'm guilty of being a dwarf!</q>
    </p>

    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <img src="assets/magnolia.jpg" alt="magnolia">
    <p><span>Magnolia grandiflora</span>, commonly known as the Southern magnolia or bull bay, is a tree of the
      family Magnoliaceae native to the southeastern United States, from coastal Virginia south to central Florida, and
      west
      to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. Reaching 27.5 m (90 ft) in height, it is a large striking evergreen tree with large
      dark
      green leaves and large white fragrant flowers. Widely cultivated around the world, over a hundred cultivars have
      been
      bred and marketed commercially. The timber is hard and heavy, and has been used commercially to make furniture,
      pallets,
      and veneer.

    <h2>Ranunculus</h2>
    <img src="assets/ranunculus.jpg" alt="ranunculus">
    <p><span>Ranunculus asiaticus (Persian Buttercup)</span> is a species of buttercup (Ranunculus) native to the
      eastern Mediterranean
      region in southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe (Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes), and northeastern Africa. It is a
      herbaceous
      perennial plant growing to 45 cm tall, with simple or branched stems. The basal leaves are three-lobed, with
      leaves higher
      on the stems more deeply divided; like the stems, they are downy or hairy. The flowers are 3-5 cm diameter,
      variably red
      to pink, yellow, or white, with one to several flowers on each stem.

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <img src="assets/tulip.jpg" alt="tulip">
    <p><span>Tulipa gesneriana L. or "Didier's tulip"</span> is a plant belonging to the family of Liliaceae. This
      species has
      uncertain origins, possibly from Asia, and has become naturalised in south-west Europe. Most of the cultivated
      species,
      subspecies and cultivars of tulip are derived from Tulipa gesneriana. The flower and bulb can cause dermatitis
      through
      the allergen, tuliposide A, even though the bulbs may be consumed with little ill-effect. The sweet-scented
      bisexual flowers
      appear during April and May. Bulbs are extremely resistant to frost, and can tolerate temperatures well below
      freezing
      - a period of low temperature is necessary to induce proper growth and flowering, triggered by an increase in
      sensitivity
      to the phytohormone auxin. The bulbs may be dried and pulverised and added to cereals or flour.

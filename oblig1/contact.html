<!-- It will show all your contact information as well as links to
your social websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.).
You must include at least three different social networks. The links must
work properly. However, you don’t need to link them to your real social
networks if you don’t want to do so. A link to the main page of the social
platform would suffice). Do not forget to include email address and phone
number2.-->

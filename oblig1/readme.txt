I also subsetted to font from 118kb to 30kb. I did not include other formates, since I used another tool to create the Subset.
I have used this tool: https://everythingfonts.com/subsetter because it allowd me to uload the rugular style.
When I tried fontsquirrel.com it said that my .ttf was corrupted.

<!-- Use this page to show to the world your best works or
projects. A portfolio project can be anything you want, such as a picture, a
drawing, a piece of art, a website, etc. You can also use assignments from
other courses such as IDG1000. You must include at least three different
projects. All the projects in your portfolio must have a title, a description
explaining what the project is about (5 or 6 lines) and an image. Example
below (text from Wikipedia):
o Title: Guernica
o Short description: Guernica is a large 1937 oil painting on canvas
by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. It is one of his best-known works,
regarded by many art critics as the most moving and powerful anti-
war painting in history.

                        This Project creates a nice Binary Clock using the Atmega48a, some 3D Printing, a DCF77, and as

                        <h3>The Main Objective</h3>
                        <p>I had the task of working on this specific lab experiment throughout the entire lecture
                            period of
                            the
                            semester. Together with a partner, we had to design two unique circuit boards for a binary
                            clock,
                            manufacture them using the CNC milling machine, and then assemble them with the necessary
                            components. At
                            any point during the semester, we could present the finished circuit board and perform all
                            the
                            required
                            tests, as outlined in the instructions, after coordinating with the examiners.
                        </p>
                        <p>More concrete steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Design of the circuit diagram using the provided components.</li>
                            <li>Test the circuit diagram with the Schematic Rule Check.</li>
                            <li>Design a <abbr title="Printed circuit board">PCB</abbr> layout based on the circuit
                                diagram.</li>
                            <li>Test the layout with the Design Rule Check.</li>
                            <li>Print the layout on paper and test again.</li>
                            <li>Schedule an appointment with the student assistant.</li>
                            <li>Create the <abbr title="Printed circuit board">PCB</abbr> under the supervision of the
                                student assistant.</li>
                            <li>Repeat the previous step if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Assemble the components on the <abbr title="Printed circuit board">PCB</abbr>.</li>
                            <li>Solder the components.</li>
                            <li>Test connections using a multimeter.</li>
                            <li>First power-up and debugging.</li>

                        <p>My friend and I had some other plans...</p>
                        <p>We bought an DCF77 from Aliexpress and tried to make the Binary Clock able to receife the
                            Time
                            over the Air.</p>
                        <p>This was even possible without WIFI. In Germany we have a Radio Frequence of 77.5kHz which
                            sends
                            out the time in a one-minute intervall. More can be read here: <a

                    <h2>The new Dezentrale Door-Locking-System</h2>
                    <section>
                        <h3>How it all Started</h3>
                        <p>The Hackspace where I'm a member of will move soon.</p>
                        <p>But, because we are moving to a not so nice part of the city, we needed a new
                            Door-Locking-System. A
                            team, with a friend and me as the Team leaders, were tasked to develop a new System for the
                            new
                            Hackspace Location.</p>
                        <p>I have always been interested in the mechanics of NFC, and this Project taught me a lot. We
                            needed
                            to
                            think
                            of a System that works reliably, fast and is secure. For this, we met with some other people
                            from
                            the
                            Hackspace to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>The Result was, that we will use NFC-Cards and also make it possible to unlock the doors over
                            an
                            SSH
                            connection. This would insure two ways if one failed.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Unfortunatly, since of now, it has not been finally build. This is because we didn't moved
                            yet.
                            But
                            there
                            are some Proto types.</p>

                            The <dfn>dezentrale <abbr title="Eingetragener Verein">e.V</abbr></dfn> is an independent
                            non-profit
                            association that runs a hackspace in the western
                            part of Leipzig. A hackspace (also referred to here as "space") is a place for exchanging
                            ideas
                            and
                            working on projects, which tend to be related to technology but don’t have to be.
                            Occasionally,
                            activities like sewing might take place as well.

                            The space is a community-managed location where people with an interest in technology can
                            come
                            together to learn from each other, work on projects, or discuss (internet policy) topics.

                            an
                            experience-sharing group of the Chaos Computer Club). The Homepage of the dezentrae e.V can

                    <h2>Endlessh</h2>
                    <!--I did not used a section here, because in my opinion it is not very meaningful for a short paragraph-->
                    <p>
                        A few days ago, I set up <a href="https://github.com/shizunge/endlessh-go"
                            target="_blank">Endlessh-go</a> (aka
                        SSH-Tarpit). It's quite
                        amusing to see how <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> scanners fall for it.
                        Brief explanation: Endlessh listens on an open port, and when someone tries to log in via SSH,
                        nothing
                        happens. However, the client is not disconnected, which causes them to be 'trapped' and slowed
                        down
                        indefinitely.
                        You can also integrate Endlessh nicely into Grafana. It looks something like this:
                        Just for fun, I looked up a German IP in the Whois that stood out particularly and sent an email
                        to
                        the
                        registered abuse contact. The IP belonged to a hosting provider. Let’s see what comes out of it.
                        I also searched for the IP on CrowdSec and quickly found it had already been flagged before.

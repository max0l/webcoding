                    <h1>The new Dezentrale Door-Locking-System</h1>
                    <p>The Hackspace where I'm a member of will move soon.</p>
                    <p>But, because we are moving in a not so nice part of the city, we needed a new
                        Door-Locking-System. A
                        team, with a friend and me as the Team leaders where tasked to develop a new System for the new
                        Hackspace Location.</p>
                    <p>I always has been interested in the mechanics of NFC and this Project tought me a lot. We needed
                        to
                        think
                        of a Sysem that works reliably, fast and is secure. For this, we met with some other people of
                        the
                        Hackspace to discuss it.</p>
                    <p>The Result was, that we will use NFC-Cards and also make it possible to unluck the doors over an
                        SSH
                        connection. This would insure two ways if one would fail.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunatly, since of now, it has not been finally build. This is because we didn't moved yet.
                        But
                        there
                        are some Proto types.</p>

                <h2>What is the "Dezentrale" You ask?</h2>
                <blockquote cite="https://dezentrale.space/ueber-uns/">
                    The "<a href="https://dezentrale.space/" target="_blank">dezentrale e.V.</a>" is an independent
                    non-profit
                    association that runs a hackspace in the western
                    part of Leipzig. A hackspace (also referred to here as "space") is a place for exchanging ideas
                    and
                    working on projects, which tend to be related to technology but don’t have to be. Occasionally,
                    activities like sewing might take place as well.

                    The space is a community-managed location where people with an interest in technology can come
                    together to learn from each other, work on projects, or discuss (internet policy) topics.

                    Perhaps you’ve heard of the Chaos Computer Club: We are the local Chaos in Leipzig. (We are an
                    experience-sharing group of the Chaos Computer Club).

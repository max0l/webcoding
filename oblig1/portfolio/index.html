<!-- Use this page to show to the world your best works or
projects. A portfolio project can be anything you want, such as a picture, a
drawing, a piece of art, a website, etc. You can also use assignments from
other courses such as IDG1000. You must include at least three different
projects. All the projects in your portfolio must have a title, a description
explaining what the project is about (5 or 6 lines) and an image. Example

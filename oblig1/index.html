                    The inner machinations of my mind are enigma.

                <!--Dont take it too serious. Nothing really came to my mind here-->
                <p>Patrick Star, <cite>Spongebob, Seasom 2 epsiode 35</cite></p>
                <p>This is my favorite quote because everybody feels like Patrick occasionally. It's important to take
                    live so serious all the time. So shutting down your mind sometimes can be really relaxing.</p>

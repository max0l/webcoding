                <p>Here I will discuss which and why I used which HTML Element and will elaborate on design decisions.

                    <h2>The main Idea</h2>
                    <p>The main idea of my Website is to look minimalistic, modern with a touch of <em>Computer
                            Science</em> and
                        Retro Gaming.</p>
                    <p>This is done by using a more Code like looking font and a VHS Screen video that acts as the
                        background to add this old VHS noise and feeling. I also tried to choose a background Video
                        which is very suptile.</p>

                            <h3>Structural HTML Elements</h3>
                            <section>
                                <h4>&lt;div class="content"&gt;</h4>
                                <p>
                                    I used the <code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;</code> to separate the video, which
                                    functions
                                    as the background, and the contents. This will ensure that I can apply CSS rules on
                                    the
                                    content more easily.

                                <h4>&lt;header&gt;</h4>
                                <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> is used to describe the Navigation Menu at the top of
                                    the
                                    website. It is fixed at the top of the Website.
                                </p>
                                <section>
                                    <h4>&lt;nav&gt;</h4>
                                    <p>The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> holds the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with each
                                        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> containing a link to a site. The
                                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> is
                                        used because it is the semantic tag exactly used for this purpose.
                                    </p>
                                </section>

                                <h4>&lt;main&gt;</h4>
                                <p>The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> is used to describe the main content of the site. It
                                    has an
                                    ID=top because I wanted the functionality that if you are at the bottom of the site,
                                    you
                                    can easily get to the top again. This is done by creating an <code>href</code> that
                                    links
                                    to the <code>#top</code> of the site.
                                </p>

                                <h4>&lt;article&gt;</h4>
                                <p>The article tag is used to define the main article. Sometimes I used an
                                    <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, which does not have to be in the main article.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is used to structure an article in itself. Here I
                                    used other
                                    elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>,
                                    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, or
                                    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.
                                </p>
                            </section>

                                <h4>&lt;footer&gt;</h4>
                                <p>Similar to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, it was used to create a footer that
                                    showed the
                                    "back to top" link as well as some other links you usually find at the footer.
                                </p>

                                <p>The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> was used to <em>surprise</em> write about my
                                    address. I used the
                                    <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> there to make the formatting better (as learned in the
                                    lecture).
                                </p>

                                <p>I used the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag to emphasize that I am the FIRST child of
                                    my parents,
                                    which I mentioned on the landing page.

                            <p>There are a few other decisions I made during this assignment that I want to elaborate
                                on.</p>
                            <section>
                                <h4>Folder Structure</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The folder structure shows that I have a main folder containing
                                    <code>index.html, resume.html, contact.html, and about.html</code>. This is all in
                                    the main
                                    folder because I think it is easier to understand than having an extra folder for
                                    every
                                    HTML file in the main directory and then naming every page index.html.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the Portfolio, it is something else because there are <em>many</em> subfolders.
                                    This would
                                    blow up the Navigation (if no Dropdown). So, the Portfolio has an
                                    <code>index.html</code> to
                                    navigate from there to the subpages. My file structure is suggested by <a

                                <p>
                                    I had considered writing a little blog before this class as well, but had no great
                                    knowledge of HTML/CSS. But now everything is coming together. I will use other tools
                                    to
                                    create one. I'm really interested in Static Site Generators and Nunjucks, for
                                    example.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I also tried to use webm's because I heard that this file format is especially
                                    well-encoded for
                                    the web.

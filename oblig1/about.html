                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Here I will discuss which and why I used which HTML Element and will elaborate on design decisions.
                    You can view my development progress on my <a href="https://github.com/max0l/webcoding">Github
                        Repo</a>.

                <section>
                    <h2>The main Idea</h2>
                    <p>The main idea of my Website is to look minimalistic, modern with a touch of <em>Computer
                            Science</em> and
                        Retro Gaming.</p>
                    <p>This is done by using a more Code like looking font and a VHS Screen video that acts as the
                        background to add this old VHS noise and feeling. I also tried to choose a background Video
                        which is very suptile.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>The Design Elements</h2>
                    <h3>Structural HTML Elements</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>
                            I used the <code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;</code> to separate the video, which functions
                            as the background, and the contents. This will ensure that when I can apply CSS rules on the
                            content more easily.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> is used to describe the Navigation Menu at the top of the
                            website. It is fixed at the top of the Website.
                            <dl>
                                <dt><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></dt>
                                <dd>The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> hold the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with each
                                    <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> holding a link to a site. The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> is
                                    used because it is the semantic tag exactly used for this propose.
                                </dd>
                            </dl>
                        <dt><code>&lt;main&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd><code>&lt;main&gt;</code> is used to describe the main contents of the site. It has an
                            ID=top because I wanted the functionality that If you are at the bottom of the site, you
                            could easily get to the top again. This is done by creating an <code>href</code> that links
                            to the <code>#top</code> of the site.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;articel&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>The article tag is used to define the main article. Sometimes I used a
                            <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> which does not have to be in the main article.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>
                            A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is used to structure an article in itself. Here I used other
                            Elements like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> or
                            <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>Similar to the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. It was used to create a footer that showed the
                            "back to top link" as well some other links you usually find at the footer.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>The Address was used to <em>surprise</em> write about my address. I used the
                            <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> there to make the formatting better (as learned in the Lecture).
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h3>Semantic HTML Elements</h3>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>I used the semantic HTML tag to emphasize that I am the FIRST child of my parents. Which I
                            mentioned on the landing page.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>I used the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag here where I described the <cite>touch of Computer
                                Science</cite>, which is not really good describeble.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;cite&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>The <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> tag was used to </dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;del&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>This was used to cross out a bad word to "replace" it.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>This was used for a longer Quote I took from the dezentrale website.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;tr&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>I used a table for my resume. I have a really nice looking resume latex template and I tried
                            to reproduce it in HTML.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;sup&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> was used to Supercase the "st" for my Birthday.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>I used the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> to explain an abbreviation /acronym.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd><code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> was used to explain what the dezentrale is.</dd>
                        <dt><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></dt>
                        <dd>A figure was used at the
                            <code><a href="portfolio/doorsystem.html">doorsystem.html</a></code> to explain the diagram
                            more.
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <h3>Other Design Decisions</h3>
                    <p>There are a few other decisions I have made during this assignment which I also want to elborate.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Folder Structure</h4>
                    <p>The folder structure shows that I have a main folder with,
                        <code>index.html, resume.html, contact.html and about.html</code>. This is all in the main
                        Folder because I think it is more easy to understand, than having for every html file in the
                        main an extra folder and than named every page index.html.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the Portfolio it is something esle because there are <em>many</em> Subfolders. This would
                        blow up the Navigation (if no Dropdown). So the Portfolio has an <code>index.html</code> to
                        navigate from there to the Subpages. Also, my file Strucutr is suggested by <a
                            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230612174518/https://www.htmlquick.com/tutorials/organizing-website.html">this
                            resource</a>, which was linked at the Oblig description.</p>
                    <h4>Aside</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have considered writing a little blog before this class as well, but had no great
                        knowledge of
                        HTML/CSS. But now everything comes more and more together. But I will use other tools to
                        create
                        on. I'm really interested in Static Site Generators and Nunjuks for example.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also tried to use webm's because I heard that this file format is espacially good encoded for
                        the web.</p>

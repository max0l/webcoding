    <p>Hello, this is my first paragraph.</p>
    <p>Hi again, this is my second paragraph.</p>
    <p>Take care, this is my final paragraph.</p>

<p>Do not use br to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in p elements and use the CSS margin property to control their size.
    <br /> I instead used the &lt;p&gt; to seperate the paragraphs. Or use CSS.

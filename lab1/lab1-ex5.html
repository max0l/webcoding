<p><del>The original code had the following problems: It had multiple headings, but h2 and h3 where not in the right order</del></p>
<p>Code fixed: Note: Only use one h1 per page - this should represent the main heading/subject for the whole page. Also, do not skip heading levels - start with h1, then use h2, and so on. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp">See this</a></p>
